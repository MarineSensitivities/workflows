## Introduction

This article by Michael et al. [-@michaelSeabirdVulnerabilityOil2022].

## Variables

![The relationship among species-specific variables, environmental variables, and sub-indices pertaining to the vulnerability of seabirds to oiling index (VSOI). Each variable receives a score based on the impact that interaction with oil is likely to have on that variable. For variable definitions, scoring, and index calculation, see below and [TableÂ 1](https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fmars.2022.880750/full#T1).](https://www.frontiersin.org/files/Articles/880750/fmars-09-880750-HTML-r1/image_m/fmars-09-880750-g001.jpg){#fig-relationships}
